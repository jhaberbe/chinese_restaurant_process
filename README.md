# Chinese Restaurant Process Inference

Particularly for the case of single cell classification inference.

Inference is available for:
- Count Data (Dirichlet Multinomial) for text-corpus type classification
- Count Data (Negative Binomial Distribution) for single cell classification
- Panel Data (Bernoulli Distribution) for classification of binary panel data


__Work In Progress__

To see usage, go to the notebooks and open `usage.ipynb`.

### TODO
- [1/2] Fully nested chinese restaurant process (Blei's infinite tree thing)

- [X] Easier to extract marker genes.
    - Call "get_class_parameters" after inference.

- [ ] Some plotting utilities might be nice.

- [ ] Confidence intervals / confidence scores might be useful.
